# Benchmark datasets for pre-training model on crystalline material graphs

This directory contains five datasets as benchmark datasets for the pre-training task on crystalline material graphs. These datasets come from three sources based on Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations.

The datasets are retrieved from `matminer.datasets`, and then preprocessed.
